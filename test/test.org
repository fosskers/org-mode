Some text before the initial heading.

* A Heading

** A subheading

*** We have to go deeper

*This is some bold text* within a normal paragraph. However I should tell you
that the paragraph doesn't end there. It has multiple lines! Oh, but having only
one would be lonely...

So we'll make /a second one/. How about some code?

#+begin_src haskell
  -- | Very complicated.
  main :: IO ()
  main = putStrLn "org-mode tests"
#+end_src

** More

And a quote.

#+begin_quote
Always keep some cash on hand, you never know.

- Albert Einstein
#+end_quote

* Another Heading!

* Heading with /markup/

さぁ日本語も入れたらどうなる？

* A simple list
