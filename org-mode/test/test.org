Some text before the initial heading.

* A Heading                                                            :tag1:

** A subheading                                                        :tag2:

*** We have to go deeper                                               :tag3:

*This is some bold text* within a normal paragraph. However I should tell you
that the paragraph doesn't end there. It has multiple lines! Oh, but having only
one would be lonely...

So we'll make /a second one/. How about some code?

#+begin_src haskell
  -- | Very complicated.
  main :: IO ()
  main = putStrLn "org-mode tests"
#+end_src

** More                                                                :tag2:

And a quote.

#+begin_quote
Always keep some cash on hand, you never know.

- Albert Einstein
#+end_quote

** Not a tag! :)

* Another Heading!

[[https://www.fosskers.ca/][Check out my website.]] It has a blog with ~code~ samples.

* Heading with /markup/

さぁ日本語も入れたらどうなる？

* A simple list

Things to do:

* List with Parens

This is a paragraph (or is it?). There's only one way to know.
I think (*we should* be bold *about*) our decisions.

- Here is an item
- This (is an item too).
- This (is an item)
- This (*A* is)
- This (*A* is) a cat
- This (*A* yes *B*), why?

* List from About page

- The [[https://github.com/fosskers/aura][Aura Package Manager]] for Arch Linux
- The [[https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node][Kadena Public Blockchain]] (core developer)
